      <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
      <p>
        physics encompasses the study observables at all scales from the macro
        scale of cosmontology to the micro scale of subatomic. at different
        scales different frameworks dominate what is observed. in our everyday
        life what we observe is dominated by classical physics but at the
        subatomic level observations are dominated by quantum mechanics. as we
        attempt to better understand subatomic observations we can utilize the
        quantum framework to enhance the way we compute. computers as we know it
        are binary - communicating either 1 or 0. looking forward we may be able
        to control computation with more granularity allowing for newfound
        algorithms and calculations.
      </p>
      <h2>robotics</h2>
      <p>
        many of the ways that we learn and build are repetive and memorizable.
        as we continue to discover what we can automate and program we will
        dedicate these tasks to robotic agents. these agents are often optimized
        to a specefic goal and will aid humans in building and discovery.
      </p>
      <h2>Nanotechnology</h2>
      <p>
        imagine a robotic arm that can build a car. now imagine a robotic arm
        that can build an arm 1/5 of its size. now continue to build arms
        smaller and smaller until you are on the atomic level. at this level we
        can curate things we have never before been able to machine. creating at
        this level is nanotechnology and it has promise in many industries.
