      <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
      <div class="future-tech-div">
        <p>
          Physics encompasses the study of observables at all scales from the
          macro scale of cosmontology to the micro scale of subatomic. at
          different scales different frameworks dominate what is observed. in
          our everyday life what we observe is dominated by classical physics
          but at the subatomic level observations are dominated by quantum
          mechanics. as we attempt to better understand subatomic observations
          we can utilize the quantum framework to enhance the way we compute.
          computers as we know it are binary - communicating either 1 or 0 -
          quantum allows for a 3rd undetermined state. looking forward we may be
          able to control computation with more granularity allowing for
          newfound algorithms and calculations.

          Provide clearer understanding of asset ownership as well as improved
          financial transparency through blockchain technologies.

      <h2>robotics</h2>
      <div class="future-tech-div">
        <p>
          many of the ways that we learn and build are repetive and memorizable.
          as we continue to discover what we can automate and program we will
          dedicate these tasks to robotic agents. these agents are often
          optimized to a specefic goal and will aid humans in building and
          discovery.

          A graduate level course looking into how robots are able to “learn” or
          imitate human critical thinking.

          Helping optimize the algorithms or design of robots to tailor to
          specific human problems

      <h2>Nanotechnology</h2>
      <div class="future-tech-div">
        <p>
          imagine a robotic arm that can build a car. now imagine a robotic arm
          that can build an arm 1/5 of its size. now continue to build arms
          smaller and smaller until you are on the atomic level. at this level
          we can curate things we have never before been able to machine.
          creating at this level is nanotechnology and it has promise in many
          industries.

        <p>
          I believe creativity, imagination and articultion shape the world. I
          hope to to promote/distribute art that invokes the human experience
          and inspires individuals.
