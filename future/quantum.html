            Physics encompasses the study of observables at all scales from the
            macro scale of cosmontology to the micro scale of subatomic. At
            different scales different frameworks dominate what is observed. in
            our everyday life what we observe is dominated by classical physics
            but at the subatomic level observations are dominated by quantum
            mechanics. As we attempt to better understand subatomic observations
            we can utilize the quantum framework to enhance the way we compute.
            Looking forward we may be able to control computation with more
            granularity allowing for newfound algorithms and calculations.
